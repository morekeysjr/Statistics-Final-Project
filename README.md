# Statistics-Final-Project
Pick two separate corporations and from www.nasdaq.com, pick the “historical quote” option and randomly select 30 opening stock prices for the last two years. Place the data into an Excel spreadsheet and outline your sampling method in the main Word document for the project. Determine a claim (prior to analyzing the descriptive statistics) based on two population means/samples. Calculate the descriptive statistics for the two separate corporations. The distribution shape should be analyzed to determine the appropriate descriptive statistics to use (mean/standard deviation versus median/IQR). The graph should be included in the main Word document for the project. Find the appropriate descriptive statistics and place this in the Word document noting any outliers or any irregularities discovered.
